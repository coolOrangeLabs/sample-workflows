## Description

This repository contains various jobs and scripts that demonstrate the power and flexibility of the AUTOMATE products *powerJobs Processor* and *powerJobs Client* as well as the CONNECT products *powerGate* and *powerPLM*. You can use the workflows to add additional value to your installations.

## Installation

Each workflow can be downloaded and copied to the Vault Client or Vault JobProcessor machines. To speed up that process a workflow installer is available that guides you through the installation process. The workflow installer can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/coolOrangeLabs/sample-workflows/releases/latest).
The workflow installer does not distinguish between server and client components and cannot not be used for deployments. It should only be used to install the workflows on a test- or demo-environment where powerJobs Processor and powerJobs Client are installed on a single machine.

If you need help with the customization or the deployment of a sample workflow and want to use it for productive puropses please contact sales@coolorange.com.
