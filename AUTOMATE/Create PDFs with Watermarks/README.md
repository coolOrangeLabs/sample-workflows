# Create PDFs with Watermarks

## Description
This workflow uses coolOrange **powerJobs** to create a PDF file from a CAD drawing and stamp a watermark to the PDF file. There are two flavors of this workflow:

*COOLORANGE.CreatePDFAndWatermark* creates a PDF file from a CAD drawing and adds a watermark in the middle of the drawing.  
*COOLORANGE.CreatePDFAndWatermarkBottom* creates a PDF file from a CAD drawing and adds a watermark to the botton right corner.

## Prerequisites
[powerJobs Processor](https://www.coolorange.com/powerjobs) version 22.0.19 or later must be installed on the Vault Job Processor machine(s)  

## Job Settings
The settings of jobs can be adjusted using the [powerJobs  settings dialog](https://doc.coolorange.com/projects/coolorange-powerjobsprocessordocs/en/stable/job_configuration/#powerjobs-settings-dialog).

## Job Trigger
In order to configure the job to be executed on a file lifecycle state transition, Vault's Custom Job Types functionality can be used. [More information](https://doc.coolorange.com/projects/coolorange-powerjobsprocessordocs/en/stable/getting_started/#how-to-embed-the-job-in-a-status-change)
